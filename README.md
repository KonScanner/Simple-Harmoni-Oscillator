- Plotting Position, Velocity, Acceleration.
  - Includes time dependence.
  - Includes sliders to change Amplitude, Frequency, Damping coefficient and Phase constant.
- Plotting Energy of a Simple Harmonic Oscillator.
  - Includes time dependence.
  
# Required Libraries
- Pillow
- matplotlib
- numpy 
- tkinter (default library for python 3)

# Purpose
The widget was made as a tool for Highschool year 10-12th Students, such that they could play around with it and visualise the mathematical equations that they were learning alongside the topic.

# Other 
- Using the pyinstaller or auto-py-to-exe module, one can convert it into an executable file and distribute it to students.
